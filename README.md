# Persistent Desktop Icons
The silent application that fixes your desktop icons behaviour on resolution changes.

<strong>Current version:</strong> 2.1a<br />
<strong>Note: </strong> Only the initial state (so when the application started) is being saved and being restored once you return to the initial resolution. So you're fine if you are using this for playing games (2160 -> 1080p -> 2160p). More coming soon.

# Todo
Currently some work is still required for the application to work:
<ul>
  <li>Keep desktop icon positions of every resolution.</li>
  <li>Launch app when Windows starts.</li>
</ul>

# What is this all about?
If you feel like you should not have to reorganise your desktop icons all the time after turning your monitor off or changing resolution (that includes playing games), then you would definitely appreciate this application. This is a silent application that runs quietly in the background and keeps the state of the positions of your desktop icons. After the screen resolution changes, the application will put back the icons where they were before.
