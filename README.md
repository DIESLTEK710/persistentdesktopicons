# Persistent Desktop Icons
The silent application that fixes your desktop icons behaviour on resolution changes.

<strong>Current version:</strong> 2.1<br />
<strong>Note: </strong> Since Windows is not calling the event that registers the resolution change on time, no icons are actually restored. Hopefully I can find out how to fix that in a future release.

# Todo
Currently some work is still required for the application to work:
<ul>
  <li>Instead of a cache, write to a file to keep changes from other resolutions.</li>
  <li>Actually hooking in before the resolution changes (Windows does it too late at the moment).</li>
</ul>

# What is this all about?
If you feel like you should not have to reorganise your desktop icons all the time after turning your monitor off or changing resolution (that includes playing games), then you would definitely appreciate this application. This is a silent application that runs quietly in the background and keeps the state of the positions of your desktop icons. After the screen resolution changes, the application will put back the icons where they were before.
