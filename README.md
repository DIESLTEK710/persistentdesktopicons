# Persistent Desktop Icons
The silent application that fixes your desktop icons behaviour on resolution changes.

<strong>Current version:</strong> 2.1a<br />
<strong>Note: </strong> The application in it's current state works fine if you are:<br />
- Using this for playing games (say you're on 2160p and have to go to 1080p for the game and come back to 2160p)<br />
- Using this when your desktop icons have moved around after turning your monitor off and on.<br />
AND: not moving any desktop icons around since the application started.<br />
Expect better support in the future.

To run the application with Windows, run the Start with Windows.bat script.<br />
You can undo this by running the Undo start with Windows.bat script.

# Todo
Currently some work is still required for the application to work:
<ul>
  <li>Keep desktop icon positions of every resolution.</li>
</ul>

# What is this all about?
If you feel like you should not have to reorganise your desktop icons all the time after turning your monitor off or changing resolution (that includes playing games), then you would definitely appreciate this application. This is a silent application that runs quietly in the background and keeps the state of the positions of your desktop icons. After the screen resolution changes, the application will put back the icons where they were before.
